# Rcode_derived_estimation
The Rcode is to reproduce simulation results in "Reducing the effect of correlated additive measurement errors on regression models with no ancillary study" By Zhiqiang Cao and Man Yu Wong.


For questions or comments about the code, please contact Zhiqiang Cao zcaoae@connect.ust.hk.
