# Rcode_derived_estimation
The Rcode is to reproduce simulation results in "Reducing the effect of correlated measurement error on regression models with no ancillary study" By Zhiqiang Cao and Man Yu Wong (under review)


For questions or comments about the code, please contact Zhiqiang Cao zcaoae@connect.ust.hk.  
This folder includes the following functions:

1 Bias_from_linear_regression.R can reproduce simulations results in Tables 1-2 of main text and Tables S1-S5 of supplementary material;

2.Bias_from_Cox_regression.R can reproduce simulations results in Tables S6-S7 of supplementary material;

3.Concordance_rate_bias_and_MSE.R can reproduce simulations results in Table 5 of main text;

4.Bias_from_multivariate_Cox_regression.R can reproduce simulations results in Table S8 of supplementary material.
